<p>One of the most important home buying tips is to decide on a budget. This helps you decide what kind of house you will end up buying. To avoid a wrong financial decision that will turn the experience nightmarish, do a careful study of your finances before you start scouting for a house. Adding up all your income, determine what kind of expenses, investments and additional financial commitments you have. In the case of your spouse, parents or children contributing to the purchase, doing a joint calculation will make the task easy. A thorough calculation will give you a rough idea about how much money you can set aside per month for the house purchase.</p>
<p>After deciding the full budget, the main objective is to break it up into down-payment and the <em><a href="https://housing.com/in/home-loans/faq/46-what-is-an-emi" target="_blank">monthly EMI</a></em> that you can afford to let go from your income without getting hard-pinched.</p>
<p>Once you determine the affordable amount, you can decide on the type and location of the house. The first payment that you have to make is the down-payment. Banks will finance a maximum of 80-85% of the property cost and you will have to shell out the other 15-20%.</p>
<p>But don’t spend every last penny in the down-payment or borrow from other sources. Beware of taking loans from sources like family members, colleagues or your office. Banks don’t include <em><a href="https://housing.com/blog/2015/11/30/7-hidden-costs-you-should-not-ignore-when-buying-a-house/" target="_blank">stamp duty and registration charges</a></em> in the property cost, so the entire amount has to be borne by the buyer alone.</p>
<p>Next comes monthly EMIs which may run for over 20 years, in many cases. Plan it keeping in mind your financial commitments (children’s education, medical needs and emergencies, family vacations, etc).</p>
